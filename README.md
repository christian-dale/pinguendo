Ping! üèì Pong! üèì

## Configuration
As of now the only configuration is the `PING_URL` variable in the `wrangler.toml` file. This is the URL that will be pinged every 5 minutes.

You can also change the interval of the pings by changing the `cron` value in the `wrangler.toml` file. The default value is `*/5 * * * *` which means that the service will ping the URL every 5 minutes. Please refer to https://cron.help/ for more information on how to configure the `cron` value.
